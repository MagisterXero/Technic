Applied Energistics:
	appliedenergistics-1.7.10-rv1-beta-rv13:
		Honestly, I'm not sure which branch is beta and which is alpha anymore, alpha was last updated on the 12th.
		So I'm tossing this up for a candidate to update to since it should have bug fixes galore.

Automagy:
	automagy-1.7.10-0.7:
		Requirement: Thaumcraft 4.24
		
Baubles:
	baubles-1.7.10-1.0.1.5:
		Our current baubles is the Vazkii fork, it is not the version we'd need for Thaumcraft.
		Update to official one listed above.
		
Big Reactors:
	bigreactors-1.7.10-0.4.0rc8:
		This is a single-line-of-code emergency update, as rc7 more or less broke the entire mod. (Oops.) 
		Power taps, fluid ports and access ports will now properly recognize and connect to the appropriate 
		other blocks - energy conduits, pipes, etc.
		
Botania:
	botania-1.7.10-r1.2-110:
		Added the ability to customize the wings the Flugel Tiara gives you, using Quartz. Confirmed, Botania is a cosplay mod now.
		Fixed Sparks making pools losing mana even if there's no place for it to go.
		Fixed wings' rendering being affected by the color of the item being held. 
		
Chisel:
	chisel-1.7.10-1.5.6b:
		A few fixes for support for things like Marble from project red, etc
	
COFH Core:
	cofh-core-1.7.10-1.0.0b6-32:
		I... don't know. No change log available?
		
COFH Lib:
	cofhlib-1.7.10-1.0.0b6-26:
		I'm sure there's a reason no change log was included on these two, but I can't imagine what it is.

EnderIO:
	enderio-1.7.10-2.0-b196:
		A whole slew of bugfixes, and a way to craft obsidian that can contain the wither, yay!
Flaxbeards Steam Power:
	flaxbeards-steam-power-1.7.10-0.26.0
		Too many to list. Alot of new content.

Forbidden Magic:
	forbiddenmagic-pr0.50:
		Requirement: Thaumcraft 4.2
		
Mantle:
	mantle-1.7.10-0.3.1:
		Note-- .3.1 of this file is not the same as .3.1-dev172, dev172 is an older file.
		
Mekanism:
	mekanism-1.7.10-7.1.0.91:
		Fixed the evil Bounding Block crash, fixed Dynamic Tank crashing when flowing icon is null
		A couple crash fixes
		
Mobius Core:
	mobiuscore-1.2.3-1.7.10:
		Mobius Core updated for 1.7.10 release, required by Opis.
		
NEI Plugins:
	neiplugins-1.7.10-1.1.0.8-unofficial:
		Updated to support the newer TConstruct version change.
		
Opis:
	opis-v1.2.3-1.7.10:
		Opis server management/map tool for 1.7.10.
		Note: Opis is set to a .disabled file by default. This is because we already have a map mod (JourneyMap).
		Multiple map mods running at the same time is both confusing and just silly. Therefore to use opis, you'd need to enable it client side.

Project Red:
	projectred-1.7.19-4.4.8-47:
		FIX: Modular dependency on World
		
Redstone Arsenal:
	redstonearsenal-1.7.10-1.1.0b4-10:
		Updating to latest COFH Core/Lib.
		
TConstruct:
	tconstruct-1.7.10-1.6.0.d40.1:
		Several changes, bug fixes and crash related fixes
		
Technomancy:
	technomancy-v.0.8.1-1.7.10
		Should only require CoFH Core, but it has content from a few other mods.

	thaumcraft-1.7.10-4.2.0.1:
		1.7.10 Release for Thaumcraft

Thaumcraft Mob Aspects:
