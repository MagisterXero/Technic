Applied Energistics:
	appliedenergistics-1.7.10-rv1-beta-rv13:
		Honestly, I'm not sure which branch is beta and which is alpha anymore, alpha was last updated on the 12th.
		So I'm tossing this up for a candidate to update to since it should have bug fixes galore.

Automagy:
	automagy-1.7.10-0.7:
		Requirement: Thaumcraft 4.24
		
Baubles:
	baubles-1.7.10-1.0.1.5:
		Our current baubles is the Vazkii fork, it is not the version we'd need for Thaumcraft.
		Update to official one listed above.
		
Big Reactors:
	bigreactors-1.7.10-0.4.0rc5:
		Dependency: Forge dependency update to 10.13.0.1205.
		Dependency: CoFHCore dependency update to 3.0.0B5-30. Thanks, mysticdrew!
		Bugfix: Fuel ejection was duping fuel. This has been fixed.
		Bugfix: Reactor controller GUI was triggering fuel ejection instead of waste ejection. Fixed.
		Bugfix: Yellorite Ore texture was improperly sized at 32x32. It is now 16x16, as vanilla textures should be.
		Bugfix: Cyanite reprocessors were kicking their inputs out of the input slot when distributing blutonium. This has been fixed.
		Bugfix: requireSteelForIron config was not always being obeyed, depending on mod load order. Fixed.
		Change: Turbine fluid ports can now only be toggled with wrenches (and wrench-like tools, e.g. Crescent Hammers), not by hand
		
Botania:
	botania-1.7.10-r1.1-106:
		Too many changes to list. Lots of fixes etc
		
Chisel:
	chisel-1.7.10-1.5.6b:
		A few fixes for support for things like Marble from project red, etc
	
COFH Core:
	cofh-core-1.7.10-1.0.0b5-30:
		I... don't know. No change log available?
		
COFH Lib:
	cofhlib-1.7.10-1.0.0b4-24:
		I'm sure there's a reason no change log was included on these two, but I can't imagine what it is.

EnderIO:
	enderio-1.7.10-2.0-b196:
		A whole slew of bugfixes, and a way to craft obsidian that can contain the wither, yay!

Forbidden Magic:
	forbiddenmagic-pr0.50:
		Requirement: Thaumcraft 4.2
		
Mantle:
	mantle-1.7.10-0.3.1:
		Note-- .3.1 of this file is not the same as .3.1-dev172, dev172 is an older file.
		
Mekanism:
	mekanism-1.7.10-7.1.0.91:
		Fixed the evil Bounding Block crash, fixed Dynamic Tank crashing when flowing icon is null
		A couple crash fixes
		
Mobius Core:
	mobiuscore-1.2.3-1.7.10:
		Mobius Core updated for 1.7.10 release, required by Opis.
		
NEI Plugins:
	neiplugins-1.7.10-1.1.0.8-unofficial:
		Updated to support the newer TConstruct version change.
		
Opis:
	opis-v1.2.3-1.7.10:
		Opis server management/map tool for 1.7.10.
		Note: Opis is set to a .disabled file by default. This is because we already have a map mod (JourneyMap).
		Multiple map mods running at the same time is both confusing and just silly. Therefore to use opis, you'd need to enable it client side.
		
Redstone Arsenal:
	redstonearsenal-1.7.10-1.1.0b4-10:
		Updating to latest COFH Core/Lib.
		
TConstruct:
	tconstruct-1.7.10-1.6.0.d40.1:
		Several changes, bug fixes and crash related fixes
		
Technomancy:
	technomancy-v.0.8.1-1.7.10
		Should only require CoFH Core, but it has content from a few other mods.

	thaumcraft-1.7.10-4.2.0.1:
		1.7.10 Release for Thaumcraft

Thaumcraft Mob Aspects:
	thaumcraftmobaspects-1.7.x-2b-17:
		This is a dev snapshot, but it's confirmed to work with 4.2 TC and 1.7.10.
		
Thaumic Tinkerer:
	thaumictinker-1.7.10-2.5.-156:
